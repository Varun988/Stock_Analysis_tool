# Stock_Analysis_tool
AI-Powered Financial Analyst Tool
This project is an AI-powered financial analysis tool designed to provide retail investors with comprehensive, data-driven insights into publicly traded stocks. By entering a stock ticker, the application fetches the latest financial data, performs fundamental and technical analysis, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by the Groq API to generate a clear "Buy," "Hold," or "Sell" recommendation with a detailed, human-readable explanation.
The use of Groq's LPU™ Inference Engine ensures that the analysis from the Llama 3 LLM is delivered at exceptional speed, making the tool highly responsive and interactive.

(Note: You should take a screenshot of your running application and save it as screenshot.png in the project folder to replace this placeholder.)

## Key Features
Automated Data Sourcing: Fetches up-to-date stock prices, historical data, and key company fundamentals using the yfinance library.
Hybrid Analysis Engine: Automatically calculates critical fundamental ratios (P/E, Debt-to-Equity) and technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD).

LLM-Powered Structured Insights: Uses a Groq-powered Llama 3 model via LangChain to synthesize all data into a structured recommendation, including a confidence score and a detailed explanation.
Simple Web Interface: A clean and intuitive UI built with Streamlit allows for easy interaction without needing to touch any code.
Modular and Extensible Codebase: The project is logically separated into modules for configuration, data sourcing, analysis, and AI agent logic, making it easy to maintain and extend.
Technology Stack
Backend/Core Logic: Python
LLM Inference: Groq API (Llama 3 70b)
AI Framework: LangChain
Data Sourcing: yfinance
Data Analysis: pandas, pandas-ta
Web Framework: Streamlit
Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

financial_tool/
├── config.py             # For LLM settings and API keys.
├── data_sourcing.py      # Handles all data fetching from yfinance.
├── analysis.py           # Performs technical analysis calculations.
├── financial_agent.py    # Contains the LLM logic, prompts, and Pydantic models.
├── app.py                # The main Streamlit UI file that orchestrates the workflow.
└── requirements.txt      # Lists all project dependencies.
